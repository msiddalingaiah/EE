    "# Electric Charge\n",
    "\n",
    "[Electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge) is a physical property of matter. There are two types of charge: positive and negative. Charges exert a force on each other depending on distance.\n",

    "Charge is measured in Coulombs, named after 18th French military engineer and physicist [Charles-Augustin de Coulomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles-Augustin_de_Coulomb). Electrons have a negative charge and protons have a positive charge of equal and opposite value. The charge on an electron is approximately $1.6 \\times 10^{-19} C$. Charge is quantized, meaning that charge is always found to be integer multiples of the charge on a single electron.\n",

    "# Voltage\n",
    "\n",
    "Voltage is the electric potential difference between two points. Voltage is a relative difference, not an absolute value like charge. Voltage is a bit like altitude, which is measured in reference to some level or ground. Height of mountains are typically measured with reference to mean sea level. For this reason, [Mount Everest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest) is highest peak above mean sea level, while [Mauna Kea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauna_Kea) is the tallest mountain when measured from base to peak.\n",
